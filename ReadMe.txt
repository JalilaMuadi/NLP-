Arabic Spell Checker – NLP-based Contextual Correction Tool
•	Developed an intelligent Arabic spell checker using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and POS tagging.
•	Implemented Levenshtein Distance and N-gram models for context-aware and edit-distance-based corrections.
•	Built a user-friendly GUI using Tkinter to allow users to input text and receive correction suggestions.
•	Integrated frequency-based scoring with a beam search algorithm to improve correction accuracy and handle Arabic linguistic complexity.
•	Evaluated performance using real-world Arabic corpora and compared results with traditional spell checkers.
